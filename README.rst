Hints
=====

Create ``android-studio/local.properties`` file before opening Android Studio and
check that ``ndk.dir``, ``sdk.dir`` and ``cmake.dir`` are set:

.. code-block:: none

  ndk.dir=/home/user/opt/android-sdk/ndk-bundle
  sdk.dir=/home/user/opt/android-sdk
  cmake.dir=/home/user/opt/cmake

Build debug APK for arm64-v8a architecture:

.. code-block:: none

  > cd android-studio
  [android-studio]> ./gradlew asDebug -Parch=arm64-v8a

Create debug APKs for all architectures:

.. code-block:: none

  [android-studio]> ./gradlew asDebug

Clean:

.. code-block:: none

  [android-studio]> ./gradlew clean

CMake generate step instructions (including Hunter work) can
be found in file ``cmake_build_output.txt``.

``HUNTER_KEEP_PACKAGE_SOURCES`` is set to ``ON`` to check that stepping into
third party sources Android Studio feature is working.
